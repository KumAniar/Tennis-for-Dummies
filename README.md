# A Guide to Tennis
So you’ve been asked by your rich friends if you want to go play tennis on the weekends. Obviously you say yes, because they’re **rich**, but the problem is you don’t know how to. Well don’t worry about that because this guide is all you need to know *(for now)*. 

There are a few key components that you need to know about. This guide will teach you 

+	How to hit the ball
+	How to keep track of how much you’ve hit the ball

## How to Hit the Ball

If you've truly never hit a tennis ball before you are planning to play, I'd suggest canceling your tennis date, but if that's not possible then I have you covered. There are 3 basic shots that you need to know: forehand, backhand, and serve.  

The forehand is hit with your dominant hand. Look at the bottom of you racket and notice the octagonal shape. Starting from the short side that is perpendicular to the racket face, label it one and go around clockwise until all sides are labeled. Place the pad of your index finger on the side labeled 4 and experiment with your swings until you hit a shot that goes over the net. Playing tennis is difficult so that last part may take a while.  

The backhand is hit with two hands, but driven with your non dominant. Place the pad of your non-dominant back hand on side 6 and the pad of your dominant index finger on side 2. This swing might be a little wore than your forehand, but don't be alarmed and just keep trying.  

The last shot is the most elusive of all. The serve. It requires many different components to come together and work in tandem. The first thing you need to practice is your toss. Practice throwing the tennis ball up high, about a foot in front of you. Once you have that consistent, work on your grip. Place the pad of you dominant index finger on side 2 and bring the racket behind your head. Put it all together and toss, then swing the racket over your head, hitting the ball over the net and into the opposite side of the court.

## How to Keep Track of how much You've Hit the Ball

Now if you've been invited to play tennis with someone, they're probably gonna want to play a set. Now it's important to understand the rules are so you don't look like a novice.  

To begin a point, you must serve into the service box, a box on the first half of the court (closest to the net). You must serve into the service box corresponding to the side you are serving from (ex: Duece side to Duece side). From then on, you can only hit into the blue court. If you are playing singles, you cannot hit into the doubles line. 

The smallest point one can play is called just that, a point. It is when one person serves and you rally the ball until it dies. Who ever hit it into the net or hit it out into the green loses the point. The scoring goes 15 - 30 - 40 and you alternate playing on the right side of the court (duece) and the left (ad), always starting with duece. 

**An Explanation of the Tennis Court**

The Blue D = Duece, The Red A = Ad

The Purple Arrows = The Doubles Alley

The Green Boxes = The service box

The Black line = The net

In tennis if it is 40-40, we call that duece (because it is always on the duece side...duh). The next point is Ad in (you have the advantage) or Ad out (the other person has the advantage. Then, whoever's advantage it is must win the next point or it goes back to duece. Once someone finally wins that last point, they win the game. Everytime there is an odd number of total games played, you switch to the other side of the net. A set is finished once someone gets to 6 games and wins by two. If it ever gets to 5 - 5, then the players must go to 7 games and win by 2. If it gets to 6 - 6, then that's a little more complicated (so don't worry about just yet).

Now this is all for singles, if you are looking for rules on how to play doubles, then it might be best to check out this [](https://www.usta.com/en/home/improve/tips-and-instruction/national/doubles-tennis-rules-tips.html#:~:text=In%20doubles%2C%20you%20and%20a,by%20serving%20the%20first%20ball.

## Good Luck

Now that's it for this guide. I hope that it serves you well and you don't make a fool out of yourself (but tennis is hard so you probably will). Tennis is truly a game that requires practice, so if you really want to get better, all you need to do is hit the ball about a thousands times until you finally hit it well. But I'm assuming that's not you, so this guide might be the only thing you need. Either way, good luck!
