## How to Hit the Ball

If you've truly never hit a tennis ball before you are planning to play, I'd suggest canceling you tennis date, but if that's not possible then I have you covered. There are 3 basic shots that you need to know: forehand, backhand, and serve.  

The forehand is hit with your dominant hand. Look at the bottom of you racket and notice the octagonal shape. Starting from the long side that is parallel with the racket face, label it one and go around clockwise until all sides are labeled. Place the pad of your index finger on the side labeled 4 and experiment with your swings until you hit a shot that goes over the net. Playing tennis is difficult so that last part may take a while.  

The backhand is hit with two hands, but driven with your non dominant. Place the pad of your non-dominant back hand on side 6 and the pad of your dominant index finger on side 2. This swing might be a little wore than your forehand, but don't be alarmed and just keep trying.  

The last shot is the most elusive of all. The serve. It requires many different components to come together and synergize and many seasonsed highschoolers still struggle with it. The first thing you need to practice is your toss. Practice throwing the tennis ball up high, about 3 inches in front of you. Once you have that consistent, work on your grip. Place the pad of you dominant index finger on side 2 and bring the racket behind your head. Put it all together and toss, then swing the racket over you head, hitting the ball over the net and into the opposite side of the court.
